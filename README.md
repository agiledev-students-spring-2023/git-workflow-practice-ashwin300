# Website & Analysis
[neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/)

I chose this website because it was helpful for me when I was studying for interviews. It's a list of problems that help build fundamental knowledge of data structures & algorithms in a structured format. Even though it does not have anything to do with the actual job as a software engineer, it's neccesary in order to pass the interviews, and helps develop problem solving skills. 

# Alice's comment
I found this website very useful. I perticuallry like the roadmap page which draw a very clear learning path for those who need. 
(ps: Does it really have nothing to do with actual job?lol)
